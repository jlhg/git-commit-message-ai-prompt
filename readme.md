# AI assisted Git Commit message AI prompt

## Introduction

This repository tracks the development of a custom AI prompt to use with the [AI Commit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Sitoi.ai-commit) VS Code extension.

## Purpose

The desired outcome of prompt is to generate [Git](https://git-scm.com) commit messages based on the [Conventional Commits 1.0.0 Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and further refine them with the rules outlined in the main document.

This message prompt features:

- Follows [Conventional Commits 1.0.0 Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
- Supports [Gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji)
- Messages are written in English
- Outputs ONLY the commit message

## Current Status

As of 20th of February 2025 I have been using the [AI Commit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Sitoi.ai-commit) VS Code extension for a couple of weeks, currently with the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev) using the `gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05` model.

It has proven to be a very useful addition to my tool kit. It helps me speed up my rate of commits, their precision, thoroughness and consistency.
