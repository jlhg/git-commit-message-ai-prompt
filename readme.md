# AI Git Commit message custom system prompt

This repository tracks the development of a custom system prompt to use with the (AI Commit)[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Sitoi.ai-commit] VS Code extension.

The desired outcome of this custom system prompt is to generate Git commit messages based on the (Conventional Commits 1.0.0 Specification)[https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/] and further refine them with the rules outlined in the main document.

I have been using this extension for a while now, currently with the (Gemini API)[https://ai.google.dev] and it has proven to be a very useful addition to my tool kit.

The AI Commit VS Code plugin helps me speed up my rate of commits, their precision, thoroughness and consistency.
